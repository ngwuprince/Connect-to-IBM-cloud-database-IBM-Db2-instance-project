# Connect-to-IBM-cloud-database-IBM-Db2-instance-project
In the first project(Connect to Db2 database...notebook) I established a connection to a IBM Db2 database on Cloud database from a Python notebook using ibm_db API.

In the second project(Access and populate IBM Db2... notebook),  I established a connection to a database instance of DB2 Warehouse on Cloud from a Python notebook using ibm_db API. Then created a table and insert a few rows of data into it. Then queried the data. I also retrieved the data into a pandas dataframe.
