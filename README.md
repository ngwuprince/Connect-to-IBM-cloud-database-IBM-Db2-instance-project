# Connect-to-IBM-cloud-database-IBM-Db2-instance-project
In the first project(Connect to Db2 database...notebook) I established a connection to a IBM Db2 database on Cloud database from a Python notebook using ibm_db API.

In the second project(Access and populate IBM Db2... notebook),  I established a connection to a database instance of DB2 Warehouse on Cloud from a Python notebook using ibm_db API. Then created a table and insert a few rows of data into it. Then queried the data. I also retrieved the data into a pandas dataframe.

NOTE: The API keys made available in this notebook is for temporary IBM Db2 database solely for learning and practice purposes. All API calls and changes made on the database using those keys reverses after 30mins.
